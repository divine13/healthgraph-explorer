healthgraph-explorer
====================

HealthGraph Explorer is an mobile application that allows you to navigate through the [Health Graph API](http://developer.runkeeper.com/healthgraph/overview).

It will allow you to easily add data to your HealthGraph account by providing basic static screen
with the most common used fields.
As a second feature it will allow you to navigate through over the API graph by connecting screens as the resources are connected with the RESTfull API.
